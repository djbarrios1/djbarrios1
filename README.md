### IT & Security Professional | Public Sector | Builder of Things That Do Things

I work at the intersection of security engineering, infrastructure, and governance — the kind of role where you're hunting IOCs in the morning, rewriting firewall rules at lunch, and arguing for security budget in the afternoon. I've built and operate a security program largely from scratch at a public sector organization, covering everything from edge networking to endpoint detection to incident response to GRC.

I didn't start in security. I came up through MSP work and years of hands-on IT, which means I understand the systems I'm trying to protect before I think about how to protect them. That foundation shapes how I approach everything.

## What I Do

**Security Operations**
Endpoint detection and response, log aggregation and alerting, IOC extraction, threat hunting, phishing simulation and awareness training. I've handled real incidents end to end — containment, forensic analysis, PII scoping, coordination with external agencies including CISA, FBI, and State Police, and full after action reporting. I build detection capability rather than just consuming it.

**Infrastructure & Networking**
Linux server administration and deployment, network architecture and segmentation, VLAN design, edge firewall configuration and management with pfSense. I've migrated environments off legacy infrastructure, rebuilt networks that grew piecemeal without a plan, and made deliberate choices about what to self-host versus what to trust to a vendor.

**Governance, Risk & Compliance**
Incident response planning tied to NIST CSF and CIS controls, policy writing, internal audits, GRC documentation. I write things down in ways that protect the organization and the people making decisions inside it. I've used that documentation in live incidents and it held up.

**Tooling & Automation**
I build tools to fill gaps rather than reach for another vendor. Python, PowerShell, and Bash are my primary languages. I know enough Java and Rust to be dangerous and to read code I didn't write. I'm better at debugging and adapting than writing from scratch, which turns out to be most of the job anyway.

## Projects

### 🔧 [Security Ops Toolkit] *(in development)*
A suite of focused, single-purpose security and system tools built in Rust. Designed in the spirit of NirSoft and Sysinternals — small, transparent, composable, JSON-first output so everything can feed into something else. Tools cover asset inventory, system health baselining, change detection, suspicious indicator hunting, log analysis, disk management, and network scanning.

> GPL licensed. Built to solve real problems in real environments, not to demo well.

## How I Think About This Work

Security is mostly reading, configuration, documentation, scripting, and fighting for initiatives that matter. The interesting parts are understanding how systems actually work, finding the gaps between how things are supposed to behave and how they do, and building the capability to know when something has gone wrong before it becomes a catastrophe.

I keep tooling lean on purpose. Every vendor is an attack surface. Every SaaS subscription is data you don't fully control and a configuration you might get wrong. Self-hosting costs time but buys visibility and control that managed services rarely match.

I came to security through real incidents before I had the full theory. That order of operations — experience first, then framework — means I think about risk in terms of what actually breaks in real environments, not just what the textbook says should.
